I am an Assistant Professor of Astrophysics in the [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/) and the [Nevada Center for Astrophysics](https://ncfa.physics.unlv.edu/) at [University of Nevada, Las Vegas](https://www.unlv.edu/).
Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the [LIGO Laboratory](https://ligolab.mit.edu/) and the [Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://mit.edu/), a CITA Postdoctoral Fellow at [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/) a PhD student at [University of Birmingham](https://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwgroup/index.php) and a MPhys student at [University of Manchester](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/).

My main research interests are all the exciting things we can learn about the extremes of our Universe through observations of Gravitational Waves (for example using the current [LIGO](https://www.ligo.org/), or future [Cosmic Explorer](https://cosmicexplorer.org/), instruments).
I am particularly interested in finding satisfactory robust connections between the observed population of [compact objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_star), mainly black holes and neutron stars, and the astrophysical processes through which these objects are formed and evolve.
I am also interested in exploring matter at its extremes, like what can be found in coalescing neutron star binaries, how this can be observed using as many astrophysical messengers as possible and help us find [the best](https://muses.physics.illinois.edu/) model for the [Neutron Star Equation of State](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10714-020-02754-3).
Finally, I enjoy working on the inference methods used to analyse these gravitational wave signals, in order to improve their speed, fidelity and robustness. This will in turn be crucial for using these observations for precision tests of General Relativity as our preferred theory of gravitation, as otherwise it's easy to confuse a claimed beyondGR detection caused by a not-accurate-enough analysis.
