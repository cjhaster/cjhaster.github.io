During the summers of 2017 and 2018 I, together with [Dr. Terrence Tricco](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~tstricco/), designed and coordniated the CTA200H undergraduate course given as part of the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)'s Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

This two-week undergraduate course is designed to provide an introduction to computational astrophysics. 
The main emphasis of the course is on the tools for efficient and effective use of computers in scientific research (both within and outside of astrophysics). 
It covers many topics, to give a sense of the usefulness of each tool, and enough basics to make it easy to learn it in more depth and provide the necessary tools and methods that will be helpful for the research projects at the center of the student's SURP.

The course materials are avaliable through [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ttricco/cta200h), and the [associated wiki](https://github.com/ttricco/cta200h/wiki).
